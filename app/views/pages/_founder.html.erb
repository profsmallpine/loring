          <p class="mb80 mb-xs-24">
            I started in the wholesale food business in 1974 as a college
            student, when I worked in San Francisco at the Hirschfelder Company,
            pulling orders and driving trucks. I was employed here for two
            summers, learning a lot about the food business in the process.
            Immediately after graduating college, I accepted the assistant
            purchasing agent position at Marin Food Specialties in San Rafael,
            CA.

              <h3>Our founder's story</h3>
              <hr>
              <p>
                Indeed, I am indebted to Joe and Larry Brucia for giving me this
                opportunity. After about six months, I was promoted to managing
                the snack food manufacturing division of the company.
              </p>
              <p>
                This experience was indispensable to my developing knowledge of
                food manufacturing, manufacturing equipment, supplies, food
                quality and sanitation and, just as importantly, working with
                people. I ran the manufacturing arm of the company from 1977
                until I departed. In 1983, I received an opportunity to move to
                Montana and assist in starting a food manufacturing operation in
                fruits & vegetables. Over the next six years, I was with the
                company, installing a variety of food processing operations in
                meat and poultry, fruits and vegetables, grain and herb
                production as well as operating a bakery.

              <h4 class="color-primary uppercase">Entry into Sales</h4>
              <p>
                In 1989, I transitioned into a variety of other food related
                manufacturing and used equipment sales activities. Unlike your
                run-of-the-mill salesman, I was able to be a valuable resource
                to my clients due to my experience purchasing new and used
                equipment and working food manufacturing facilities. In 1991, I
                was offered a position in the new equipment sales arena and
                joined Western States Machinery Corp., headquartered in Pacific
                Grove, CA, where I was assigned the NW territory. I owe a lot to
                John Chaffin of Western States because of the trust he placed in
                me when I had no track record.
              </p>
              <p>
                I did not have much experience in sales and, quite frankly,
                floundered for the first couple years as I learned how to sell
                and to be of value to my prospective customers. Even though I
                had little money at the time, I paid a substantial fee to take a
                Dale Carnegie class, hoping that that would provide some
                guidance in my sales endeavors. After much time and effort, I
                slowly began to make sales and gain confidence in my new role.
                At various times, I took each of my children along with me on a
                sales trips so they could understand what their dad did when he
                was gone. In 1999, I decided to venture out on my own and
                incorporated Loring Industries, Inc. as a contract dry packaging
                company and named the company after a family surname.

              <h4 class="color-primary uppercase">BEST</h4>
              <p>
                2000 was the year I began selling for BEST (Belgian Electronic
                Inspection Systems) when they opened their sales activities in
                the United States through M. Parise & Associates. I truly
                appreciate Mike not only for providing this opportunity to my
                company, but also for everything he has done for me over the
                years. BEST has been a tremendous company to represent and I
                have enjoyed being a part of a real-world success story over the
                last <%= Time.now.year - 2000 %> years.
              </p>
              <h4 class="color-primary uppercase">Our Philosophy</h4>
